# LoL-Discord-Bot
NoCl Discord Bot is a for the NoCl discord server. The server is titled NoCl to remind FennecPup to keep salt to a minimum. 

The bot is ultimately just to provide stats for us that we would otherwise have to find on leagueofgraphs.com or some similar website. In game, we would like to look up build recommendations, ban recommendations, how teammates are performing, etc. There will be a mix of accessing Riot's API and scraping information off of websites such as leagueofgraphs.com and champion.gg to help figure out runes, builds, bans. 

Outside of the game, we would like to be able to track each others rank & LP, recent match history, and be able to call up stats from fun games we had but weren't able to play together.

The project is to give us something to collaboratively build and personalize with NoCl based flavor text and inside jokes.
